I have created Pitagoras based equations for convertion six-dimentional data to four dimentions using tetrahedron as model. 6Dscale file shows scale created from 0 till 1 after implementation interval points repeated 6 times that gave 4D output. An example: 0 0 0 0 0 0 gives the output -2 -2 7 -2. Scale from 4D results was prepared in CSPACE 1.0.1.26 software.
